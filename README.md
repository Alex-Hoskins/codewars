# Code Wars
Here is a repository filled with daily Code Wars challenges and solutions. The purpose is to sharpen my problem solving and coding skills. Everyday I imrove my skills by solving these problems.

## Optimizations:
I am constantly refactoring my code to make it more efficient, easier to read, or both! I begin each excercise by rereading the problem and using pseudocode to come up with a solution.

## Lessons Learned
**1)** Using a regex with the match method can help you see if a string contains a certain letter, number, or substring.

**2)** Optimize code by not unnecessarily assigning information to variables. This might be better for readability, but may slow down your code significantly when dealing with large sets of data.

**3)** You can seperate a sentence that is a string into individual words by using string.split(' ') method. You can pass a variety of arguments into this method. Using ' ' will seperate the string by space.

**4)** When needing to compare or count letters where capitilization doesn't matter, you can us the toLowerCase() or toUpperCase() method making the letters equal.<br/>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase
