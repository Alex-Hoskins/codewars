## Optimizations:
I am constantly refactoring my code to make it more efficient, easier to read, or both! I begin each excercise by rereading the problem and using pseudocode to come up with a solution.

## Lessons Learned
**1)** Using a regex with the match method can help you see if a string contains a certain letter, number, or substring.

**2)** Optimize code by not unnecessarily assigning information to variables. This might be better for readability, but may slow down your code significantly when dealing with large sets of data.
